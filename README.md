# Cash flow - Springboot backend 
This is a pet project for cash flow management whose goal is to practice microservices architecture development.
The idea is to transform the excel spreadsheet found [here](https://luz.vc/planilhas-empresariais/planilha-de-fluxo-de-caixa-excel) 
in a webapp, using spring boot to implement the microservice on the backend and Angular on the frontend

## Tech stack
- Spring boot / Java
- MySQL
- Docker
- Angular/TypeScript 


## How to run with the development environment

- Ensure a properly configured MySQL database instance is running and create a new database to be used by this application  
- edit the properties __spring.datasource.url__, __spring.datasource.username__, __spring.datasource.password__ in the file  **src/main/resources/application.properties** and ensure they are properly configured for your enviroment. Property names are self explanatory.
- If you have apache maven (3.1+) on your system's classpath, just run:
> mvn spring-boot:run 
- otherwise anf if you are on a linux box, run:
> ./mvnw spring-boot:run
- ... on a windows machine
> ./mvnw.bat spring-boot:run


## How to run in production mode
	mvn -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=production spring-boot:run
